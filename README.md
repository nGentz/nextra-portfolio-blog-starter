## How I made this portfolio / blog starter
This site was developed with [Nextra's blog template](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/c8238813e1ba425cdd72783d57707b0ff3ca52ea/examples/blog) and using OpenAI's [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/).

When building [my portfolio website](nickgentz.com), I was inspired by the many minimal next.js portfolio sites available, but wanted something that was free, lightweight, and easy to update with `.mdx` files. This need led to me building this template and wanting to make it *open source*.
